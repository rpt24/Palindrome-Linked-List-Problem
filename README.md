# Palindrome-Problem
This problem is to find if a list is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence of items that would be the exact same in forward or reverse order.

For my solution, I take example data and plug it into a function I created to see if a list is a palindrome. This source code is done in python and makes use of functions and data structures. My function for checking for a palindrome will compare the list to itself in reverse order and return a boolean value, true or false, if it is or is not a palindrome.
